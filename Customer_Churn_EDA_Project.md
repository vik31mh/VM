------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Project Title

**Customer Churn Analysis Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Problem Statement

Customer churn is a major concern for financial institutions, as losing
existing customers leads to reduced revenue and increased acquisition
costs.

This project analyzes the Churn Modelling dataset to understand the
factors influencing customer exit behavior. The goal is to identify
patterns, trends, and risk segments to support better retention
strategies.

-   Conduct univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis\
-   Identify patterns, trends, and anomalies\
-   Summarize insights for decision-making\
-   Provide conclusions and actionable recommendations

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Tools and Libraries

-   Python\
-   NumPy\
-   Pandas\
-   Matplotlib\

## 7. Key Insights Summary

1.  Older customers show a higher tendency to churn.\
2.  Churn rates vary significantly across geographical regions.\
3.  Inactive members are more likely to exit.\
4.  Customers using only one product have higher churn rates.\
5.  High balance customers show noticeable churn behavior.\
6.  Salary has minimal influence on churn.\
7.  Credit score has moderate impact.\
8.  Tenure shows stability for long-term customers.\
9.  Churn is influenced by multiple interacting factors rather than a
    single variable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Conclusion

The analysis shows that churn is driven by a combination of demographic,
financial, and engagement-related factors. Customer engagement and
product diversification play a significant role in retention. Regional
differences also impact churn behavior.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 9. Recommendations

1.  Improve customer engagement strategies for inactive members.\
2.  Promote multi-product adoption through cross-selling.\
3.  Develop region-specific retention strategies.\
4.  Focus on retaining high-balance customers.\
5.  Strengthen onboarding experience for new customers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Final Remark

This exploratory analysis provides meaningful business insights that can
help reduce churn and improve customer retention through data-driven
strategies.
